Out of the 24 counties in the state of Maryland, Montgomery County is the most populous. It boasts the 20th highest household income in the country, and interestingly, the highest percentage of residents over the age of 25 who hold post-graduate degrees (Montgomery County, Maryland). High household income and education indicate that Montgomery County could be a good place to live - but they aren't the only things to consider.

When evaluating a place to work/live/visit, safety is paramount, and one of the largest components of safety is crime. Montgomery County is a large geographical area, covering 507 square miles with a population of over 1 million residents, and therefore it is not sufficient to simply look at overall crime rate statistics to determine if it's a safe place to live. We asked ourselves the following questions:

- How has crime in Montgomery Changed over the past 7 years, in terms of rates, trends and patterns?
- What impact did COVID have on crime in Montgomery County, and why?
- What impact have different Montgomery County police departments had on crime rates?
- What sub-regions of Montgomery County are safer to live in, and why?
In order to answer these questions, we embarked on a data analysis journey to determining whether Montgomery County is a "safe" place to live, hoping to find evidence that crime was trending downward, the police department was effective at containing and addressing crime, and if there are any demographic factors that contribute to different patterns within the county.

We produced 6 analyses to answer these questions
